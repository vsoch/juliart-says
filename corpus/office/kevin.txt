Present company excluded?

It smelled terrible.

So
Cause Im in a band. We really rock.
I accept your decision!
Something with animals. Or people.
We really dont do a lot of weddings. We actually dont play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pams wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Come on
Yes.
Dwight
Yeah
Pam. Jim Halpert
I won the 2002 $2
All-in.
Three queens.
I suck.
I do not want to talk about it.

Absolutely
Has anyone in the office bought anything nice recently?
Yeah.
Oh
An emergency like
Dont yell at me.
Why dont we just ask her if she took the $3
Oh
Thanks

Were in the process of interviewing everyone in the office. I think its kind of fun. Its a great chance to catch up with people.
I dont think it was him.
Angela thinks its an insult when she calls me a genius
I dont know.
Why? Whats going on?
Why?
All right.
Ive never seen it.
Who?
How do you know?
You have a crush on Roy.
You have a crush on Roy. Unbelievable.
Does he excite you? Does he get your blood flowing? [Oscar growls]
Does he get your... [Oscar growls]
[singing] Roy and Angela sitting in a tree K-I-S
No.
You would have to take some from petty cash.
In Oscars drawer.
Well
Oh
But you can if you want to.
Oh
I didnt steal $3
I talked to Creed
No
No. Angela
Yeah. [Oscar bumps into Kevin as they leave the conference room] God.

Oops. Um

Michael

The tires look pretty worn.
Thats not fair.

Then why are there two flyers?
Right.
I didnt see where it was.

Angela.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Are you sure? It is a big deal.

How much did you win?
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.

No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassists wedding and our guitarists wedding.
Attention
My tire blew out on the way here
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
...What?
I almost died.
Wow.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Is everything ok
Hey Pam.
Oscar. Angela.
Yeah.
Its complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
No
No
Good thing you didnt listen to me.
Later
Man
Youre wearing a womans suit?
Who makes it?
Karen
Michael
Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Five bucks says its over 50.
Ever since March Madness ended
[mouths] Damn...
On what?
Nice.
Long johns? A shaw?
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.

Ryan

Yes.
[in womens bathroom] This is so great
Youre in here.
[all get up to leave] OK.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. Thats all Ive ever wanted.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet
Are you going to try it?
Angela
Why dont you go Michael?
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Whats different about you? You look worse.
So Jim
Pam is taller.
Yes. She has bigger breasts
I think Karen has a prettier face.
Well I mean Pams face is really pretty too. Its a very tough call.
Yeah.
Will do.
Do you think its gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
What?
Yeah
I love fake boobs. Often times
Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.
[raises hand] Do we have to?
[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
Are you kidding me
Are you kidding me?
Whos we
Oh
Oh
I bet you were.
What
Whoa!
[applauds]
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well
Michael?
You cannot make me run.
It is not a real charity. Its stupid Michael
You didnt run for me...
...when I thought I had skin cancer.
No.
I just dont want to run. I didnt bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Back off me.
I knew it!
[rubbing hands in Ryans hair] Fire!
You werent here for that.
When he started the fire.
Little old man boy.
Bearded man boy.
No way!
Yeah
Oh
What does that mean?
Tuna Tuna Tuna.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
Tuna. Check you later.
Dude
That was so awesome.
Isnt 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Wait! Alfredos Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?
No
Oscar
Oh no
We think its a straight forward kidnapping.
Whats going on?
Were getting hungry out there. Were all accomplices now anyway
Good pizza.
Different stuff.
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why its so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity
Dammit.
I know whats right
I dont know.
I do gamble Michael.
The mob.
[shakes head no]
Yeah
Shh.
True
[looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!
I kind of know what its like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
Michael
Damn it!
Damn it! [banging machine]
Yeah
Oh
You never call back.
About what?
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh
[sitting down
[off screen] Hurts like hell.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Not anymore.
Its a bitter situation.
No
Yes.
Nice.
Michael
We need to assemble the five families.
We have to.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. Theres Michael Scott
[to Andy] Im calling the meeting anyway.
[nervously stuttering] I... have... things...
We want our parking spaces back!
W.B. Jones construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
After Stacy left
We did it.
We got our spaces back.
Later.
Way to go
Oh God.
Michael you could put your initials in it.
Hey Pam
All the girlfriends that Ive ever had have worn glasses.
Yeah
Like librarians.
Could you just say
Michael
[chuckling] Its Michael versus Stanley
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies
Im gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar
Andy
Yeah.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Okay
Oooh! [Kevin and Andy add suggestive bow-chicka-wow-wow vocals]
Hi.
I do the numbers.
Do you want a M&M?
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesnt take them.
Yeah.
Hi.
I cant decide what to get.
Well I like pretzels
Hmm...
Im totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Okay
Yeah
No
Just hurry. [hangs up]
It was great to see you
Yeah
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Yeah.
Ill go to the diner with you.
Yeah
Me too.
That seems early
Thatd be DUI.
Ill always remember Merediths back. Thats all I can see from my desk. All that red hair
Hi
What do you mean?
Wha...
Im a little mad
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the persons will
In every good hostage movie
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
[waves] Hi.
Jim
Im gonna take so much money off that guy. That guy is a whale. Im gonna clean him out. This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
Hes not my client.
Hey Oscar
When you get a loan
No
Lets say you tell the bank that youre going to open up an ice cream store but instead you buy an ice cream cart? Technically you are still selling ice cream.
Gambling debts? What?
Whats a bookie? I dont even know what youre talking about. You are weird. You are a really weird dude
Okay
We will be selling ice cream.
The business will have a mobile component.
In a way.
We have flavors. [hands over a flavor menu to the banker]
Um
We would buy the ice cream in a store. Or we would make it our self.
No.
I have a lot questions for you too.
If you grant me this loan about how long will it take for me to have cash in hand?
Niiice.
Ive got it.
Oh my God I think weve been the target of a sting operation.
Are you wearing a wire?
Please do not hurt me.
Im sorry just dont be mad at me.
That little dude may hurt me if I dont get that bank loan.
Im gonna sell ice cream out of a cart.
Why not?
[nods] I know.
We need a secret signal that lets me know if Im talking too much.
You have a great... vest.
Strawberry.
Hi Brad
Oh boy... [Kevin stands and drops his briefcase
[outside the office with a cart
No
Ten dollars.
Ice cream! Gooooood ice cream!
Pam
Yeah.
Hi Jan.
Hows the candle game?
Cool. Thank God they found her
Hey!
Thank you
Wait
Oh
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan]
Yeah.
You too.
Because youre kind of doing Michael Clump.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?
Oh come on! Hes right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired. [to Jim] Oh check it out
Its a trap.
I think were out.
I think she got it as a tip
But Phyllis
Michael
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Yeah
Oscar
Hi
Federal and State.
Fine. [throws down microphone
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! Ive been up since four!
Michael
You love your mom.
T minus...
You did it
[with mouth full] Yes.
So Jim
Michael
Michaels a genius.
Hey Michael
Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?
Well
Yeah
Whoo-hoo!
Hot tamales.
Uh oh.
Oh
Because I wouldnt want an innocent person
How about
Were not listening.
Oh come on
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank
She looks like a monster.
That is not the question.
Yeah
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.
So what do we do now?
The debate is whether she is hot.
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful
Are you serious? Jim
Hes making all these fancy
[Kevin sits down
Ladies and gentlemen
[surprised] Wait
This is ridiculous.
Its out in the hall.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I cant keep doing this forever.
Call it.
I would want to live with no legs.
Michael
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
[in the lunch room
Im almost done.
I didnt eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didnt eat all my lunch.
It... yeah.
Wait
Any cat
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angelas computer
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angelas computer]
[gasps]
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
No way.
Oh
[snickers]
This is getting weird.
Ohhh...
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Oh
No
I miss Stacy.
I cant even imagine.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
A week later a friend of mine calls me up
My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning
Hello.
Im from here!
Thank you
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. Its really cool.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity]. No
I think I blew it. It all happened so fast. So... fast.
Hey
Are you on email?
Cool. Bye.
Good Valentines.
I think I should call her.
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
But I do like her just the way she is.
Andy
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Right.
[puts hand on Jims hand] Like that?
Lynn
I think you have the best smile. Id like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Ni-
Hey!
Michael?
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Ok.
That hes wasted 15 years of your life?
Michael is that scotch?
Pam?
When will the new copier be ready?
You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Sometimes.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. Hes a good guy. And hes super funny. Yeah
I think hes singing.
Michael
But you didnt want to start with us?
Phones?
Oh
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Yeah
Okay. Andy
Oh
Hold it.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phylliss phone rings]
[running to the phone] Just... dont answer that call!
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andys phone rings]
Wag.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boys name?
Try it in another sentence.
I guess I could be nicer.
Hi.
At least once a year
So
Yeah.
Yeah. This place is great.
Im sorry.
Yeah. Respect the lei.
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?
I wanted a cookie.
Michael
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
Set!
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Its six to six. Its a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Kelly
I thought that I could do it.
Yeah?
I would very much like to do that.
Q.
T.
I might have extra
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
Reeeeally.
[looks at Andy and giggles]
[still giggling] Tea.
You would.
[sarcastically] Oh
Do you like it as much as you like mens butts?
Because youre gay.
I need to do mine first. Whos been saying that theres another person inside of me
Stay.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought Oh
Hey
Hey
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Will you take a check?
Cool. In the memo line
Wait til Monday.
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Totally!
Yeah.
Yeah
What does a bean mean?
Michael
What does a bean mean?!
What does a bean mean?
Michael!
So... youre going to provide them
What the hell?
Oh yeah.
People dont think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but Im going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought
She thought I was your boyfriend.
Oscar
Im not gay. Im Kevin.
Yes.
Are you seeing anyone right now?
Cool.
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Yes!
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
Its a good idea.
Yeah. But thats easy enough for you to say
What else you got?
Its gonna be fine. Its gonna be fine. Pams here. [knocks on Pams door] Pam? [knocks again]
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished
Thank you.
They were stolen?
What?
But that was my only pair of shoes.
Well... well damn-it.
Okay.
Oscar. Angela.
Im trying to decide if I have time to pee.
The peeing is fast
Oh
Who would want it?
What an awesome party. The best wedding Ive ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece
Jims gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
[answers phone] Hello.
Oh man
Um
Six-six-five-zero.
Wait a minute. Yes I am.
No. That... I
No-
Shoot.
I usually can think quick on my feet
Oh God. I wouldnt last in jail Oscar. Im not like you.
Oh you dont know about jail? Oh you would love jail.
Because... You would love it.
Hi Pam
Okay
Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.
They have no idea what happened.
Oooh yeah... [people chuckle] Jim and Pam!
[to Angela] Shhhh...
[to Angela] Shhh...
Whos pickle?
Yes! Thats what Im talking about.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... whered you get that hat?
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
[whispers to Erin] Im gonna kill you.
Yeah. Every single day.
I dont want people making fun of my weight.
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?
Im not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Well stay late.
Open QuickTime.
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. Ive done this.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
Hi.
Because of s*x?
My moneys on Pam.
Michael could win.
Why cant you just agree with me sometimes?
Were here for the show
No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
[retching sounds coming from the mens bathroom
It smells like throw up in here.
Whoa
Oooo
He lives on Sesame Street
Yall.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.
Nice.
That could be a good sign.
Now
Michael
[at window in conference room] Check it out
Does and email count?
Yeah. [everyone raises hands again]
Hey.
Jim said that?
Jim said that?
No
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake
Congrats Phil!
Michael its me
When can I sit on your lap?
Thats really comfortable. [Michael gasps]
I dont know. I didnt know you were gonna ask me that.
I didnt know. Nobodys ever let me sit on their lap before.
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really dont want to mess up on this list.
What about if I tell you the things I dont want?
I didnt even get to tell you what I wanted!
Awesome.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
He got scented candles!
[singing] Christmas tree
Thank you.
Yeah.
Just cause you have liquid that doesnt make it a toast.
Hi!
What
Hi.
Jo
Nice!
I cooked my way through Julia Childs cookbook
Pregnant Pam and I
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
I think it should be a surprise.
For the love of God
Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Stick spicy food up her butt.
Our ultra feast menus theme[/b]: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille
Im petrified.
[as he appears from behind the door] Ta-da!
Yes!
Oh
Erin
Yes!
Bye.
Hi.
She touched my shoulder.
No.
Yes.
Hi.

Yeah.
Yeah.
You said she liked me.
Ive dumped better than Erin.
Lynn was way hotter than Erin
Yeah
Jo
Just because Jo has no life
Oh Im in.
You are never going to find them.
Im going to enjoy this.
[muffled] Im still enjoying it.
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
No
What -
Um
Yeah. When we walked in here
Yeah! [hugs Pam]
Oh
Yeah!
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
When a new mom hears a baby cry
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pams chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Yeah!
This isnt funny. I dont talk like that. [all continue laughing]
No. I wont say it.
Angela
Yeah
Man
Theyre making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Im not crying.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Yeah.
Erin
So if you need anything
C is for suspension.

No but thats not fair.
Hey guys its my turn.

Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Yeah

No
This all sounds great to me. [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that theyre bad. I dont know what to think.
Jim only says that because hes in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that
Yes!
Yeah
Yes.
Oh

Hot!
That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo

Whoa.

Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Okay... well what do I want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do I want?...
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
What do I want?... Im looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera
Later
Exactly.
We need a warning signal.
We do.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
I know! Its alphabetical.
Warning! Warning! Warning!
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.

Good old Kevin. Hell do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK
Guys! When I was a kid
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
Right. My mom-
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.

Here...
Oh hey guys.
OK Darryl
No Jim
[laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell em why its called that
Yeah
[mouthful of food] I understand.
I think this thing is broken.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Its been out for ages
Jim
Come on
Im only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that dont exist like ghosts or mummies.
Yeah [nervously]...prank
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Exactly.
Nooo!
Thank you.
Im on it.
Good thinking.
Apparently a big client for this company
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Uh
Yeah.

Hey

[music plays] Whoo!
Mm-hmm.
Are you serious? From Star Trek?
Yeah.
Guys

Not food and stuff.
Oh
The fire pit is a no-brainer.
[tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.
Well
Yeah. But not just the cookies
Kay
Thank you.
I dont know.
Yes. I am an accountant.
Never trust a cookie with a womans name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. Theyll just break your heart.
What?!? No!
No! This is not fair! This is my idea. Hes trying to steal it because hes jealous of me.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
How can we do that? Shes simply wonderful.
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question
Hey
How ya holdin up...because of your wife leaving you?
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh yes.
Good cookie.
I dont wanna put you out
Hey.
So
Oh yeah!
I cant help it

Okay. [leaves]
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh
Ron Artest

Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.

Kelly

A little bit
Oh

Hi!
Phillip is so fat.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny
Im going to call him Little Kevin.
I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
[giggles] Little Kevin.
Extremely
Well
Hey!
Because I feel like that Im in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know
When do we leave?
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys
Are those the lyrics?
One order.
Dude
One order.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery...
Oh
Listen
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Its not a kid on a bike. Its a man in a car.
Yeah [all murmuring]
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang
Bye.
Whether its a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace
Cookies
[singing] Oh
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
I do.
Oh
[looking pleased] Hey guys
No. Wait
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Thats true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. Cause Darryl
No
Hungrier.
Hungrier.
Oh yeah
[holding mobile phone up] Go.
Perfect! Now people will think Im doing hot girls all day.
Okay

No guys
Nice.
When that went up there
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say
oooh
Huh. Yeah
Hot tub party?
I do. [applause] Come on everyone...
Come on Jim
None taken.
Shh
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar
Welcome home.
Yeah.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. Shes sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscars desk] Get lower.
Dwight couldnt get it up for Nellie?
Tip-top shape.
Ooh
Yeah. Man
Yeah
because he fired you which means apparently youre living in your car now.
Wait
Its going to be super weird
Hey
Oh man
Creed
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Whoa
So Dwight doesnt understand silent auctions. I guess hes the stupid guy in the office
Im sorry
No. No hes not.
Youre welcome!
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
My dog Ruby doesnt do anything
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow
Doesnt really poop. Its perfect
She smells horrible. Its unbelievable. But I dont want to put her in the bath
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess theyre just jealous
The branch closed. Forever.
Hey
Wait
Even I know thats weird.
Oh
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldnt get the pieces to fit right. Then one day
The one who uses the doorbell
Angelas cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you cant eat cats. You cant eat cats
Ill take him.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
Go ahead
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh
A wheel is supposed to spin.
[spinning a new ‘chore wheel while everyone claps] Okay
This sucks.
Yeah
[grinning] Oh boy! Whats happening?
[excited] Heifers International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like
Whats the craziest place youve ever made whoopie?
Totally. George Clooney.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place youve ever made whoopie?
And John Wayne?
Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
Yeah
Thats me. [repeats]
As would I.
My name is Kevin.
That is my name.
They call me Kevin.
Cause thats my name.
Next stop pies!
At five? Thats only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Wh...
314 pies.
Well
Well now I dont even feel like pie. Wait...no its back.
Guys
I insult you
I insult you! To your face!
Then why dont you do something about it?
You dont have the guts. You stupid
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
It turns out
Thats beautiful. No
I really want to. Whatever happens
What happened?
Yeah
[to Angela] I dont know what youre talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
I... did not.
[laughing in Oscars direction] Oh really

What are you doing?
Well Oscar
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
Come on Oscar
It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having s*x with the senator and Angela doesnt even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Nice!
Thats the winter season.
Whats happening in three months?
Make it go taller.
No
Youre not getting this
Me and Pete are building a tower.
Obviously. Hes a sweet kid
Huh?
Yep
Okay

So were not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela
Well
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes
No.
Come on

Oh
Yes
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
No
I wish my car had a bathroom.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
To me
No.
Oh
The Hawks are terrible. Theyre always terrible.
No.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Yeah [kisses Darryl on the cheek]
I think he needs some hugs
An Escalade.
Big mistake.
So does this mean youre gonna take Darryl back?
Well
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler
I wonder what happened over there. Ive been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap
Hey
Taste test? Im in!

Yeah!
I dont get it.
A lightbul--
Whoa.
Whoa.
Thats a flush.
Ooh
Ooh
Okay
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your pen1s.
Lets get this over with
Meredith
Angela
Hey. So
OK. I understand. Ill just stay here
[at Phillips party] Opening with pub pastries? Thats a bold play. Theyre saying
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and youre just using them. Again
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So
[to entire office]OK
[to Angela] Ew! Ill be your foot buddy.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky
You know Pams mural? Well
Whoa.
Pete...
Pete what?
Im Kevin.
Didnt you two used to do it?
Oh
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic
Packer
They do. Its awful. And
You dont know that.
James Bond was a spy.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh
Why would you ask me?
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Nope. I did not see you either.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Yeah. No
Uh oh. Shes doing it again.
[Meredith laughs] Whats going on? Oh
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
This is a documentary? Oh
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Andy
Of course.
What was that word they said when they showed me Skrald mand? Whats that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Cool. Superhero.
Ooh
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didnt know
Yes
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh
Ohh.
Yes!
Uh huh.
Of course.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
No.
This is flatter.
I cant. I love them all too much. And
Fine. [throws plane
Im not giving up. Im going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Wait
Ive never met anyone like that.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I dont know. You know whos really funny? This bird
Our question is—it seems dumb.
Well
Ooh
I dont think so.
No
Dwights the new manager. He freaking did it.
Yeah
What do you think that was about?
[everyone applauding] Awesome!
Night
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Ooh
Guys.
Guys.
Guys.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says bold front instead of cold front? Its insane.
Philllip
Whoa.
Thats totally uncool.
Right. Now.
Oh
What? Im moving the ink down in my pen
Dont tell me what to do!
No
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Hes not that smart. He doesnt know where I hid his duck.
Cant hear you. Im giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Phillip got this for me?
That was a really cool move.
Whoa.
What a chubbers. Whoa.
Im losing my balance.
Whoa!
You wanna play with the cactus?
So
Bye
Yeah.
Sir

What does that mean?
Im...good.
[crying] At least I got chocolate.
Well
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Well
Youre just saying that to make me feel better.
Is that all it was?
Come here [hugs Dwight]
I missed you!
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. Its in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
[laughing] Yeah
Wheres the
Okay.
[reading] Arise

Ooh! Yes. Uh
Oh
Hey

If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience

Oh

[sniffles] Its just that Im so emotional.
No
